# Hacker News Dark

[Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aruncveli/userstyles/refs/heads/main/sites/hackernews/hackernews.user.css)

Dark theme for Hacker News.

I have not created an account or posted in Hacker News (yet). So, those pages,
if different in styling from the read-only pages, are not covered.
