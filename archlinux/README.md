# Arch Linux Dark

[Install](https://github.com/aruncveli/userstyles/raw/main/archlinux/archlinux.user.styl)

Dark theme for some (simpler) Arch Linux pages: Home, Packages, AUR and
Download.

For the AUR cgit, dark mode styles from
[cgit homepage](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) are copied as is.

Since the Wiki is a different kind of beast, I recommend the amazing work put
into [Wikipedia-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/Wikipedia-Dark). ðŸš€ Or
the built in Wiki dark mode which has performance issues in Firefox.
